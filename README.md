# CS321-Project_2

# Abstract: 
This project required us to implement an assembly in java. To do this, we started by implementing a stack data structure (Stack.java.) This stack was then used to convert an infix expression into a postfix expression (Postfix.java.) This converted postfix expression then allowed us to use another stack to go from the postfix expression to assembly code (Assembler.java.) 

# Results: 
The result of this project is a program that can take in a file with each line containing a separate infix expression and then output the infix expression, the postfix expression, and the assembly code to evaluate the expression.
